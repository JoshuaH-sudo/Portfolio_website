        In my role, I spearheaded the development of new UI interfaces and features
        for our applications. Collaborating with diverse disciplinary teams,
        including product, customer satisfaction, and accounting, was a key aspect of
        my responsibilities. I played a pivotal role in translating product team
        requirements into efficient code and providing guidance to colleagues on CSS
        techniques for effective troubleshooting. <br />
        <br />
        Ensuring continuous deployment was a priority, and I achieved this by
        creating adaptable code capable of swift adjustments in response to evolving
        business requirements. My achievements include leading the implementation of
        critical features like a sorting system based on user order history and a
        user-friendly weekly overview to view their current orders. <br />
        <br />
        I successfully contributed to the transformation of an application burdened
        by three levels of legacy code into a modernized version, receiving high
        praise from users. Notably, I surpassed deadlines on various features by
        delivering effective solutions and resolved major bugs affecting
        business-critical components such as customer onboarding. <br />
        <br />
        My extensive knowledge of CSS played a crucial role in troubleshooting both
        common and niche problems. And providing that knowledge to the rest of the
        team. Overall, my commitment to excellence in front-end development is
        demonstrated through the successful delivery of high-quality solutions and
        contributions to project success.

            I have had the pleasure of working closely with Joshua for 6 months at Smunch. He is an <strong>exceptional</strong> software engineer with a deep understanding of software development principles and never shies away from a challenge. <br />
            <br />
            Joshua consistently impressed me with his ability to tackle complex technical and product challenges. He played a crucial role in developing necessary features such as a <strong>preference sorting algorithm</strong>, which helped boost session conversion rate and provided a better user experience. <br />
            <br />
            Putting Joshua's technical skills aside, he is an amazing <strong>team player</strong>, is always there to assist his colleagues when needed, and continuously provides feedback on how we can improve things, proposes new ideas from both a technical and business perspective, and is always working on improving his skillset by asking questions and pair programming with other colleagues. <br />
            <br />
            I would highly recommend Joshua for any software engineering role, as I believe he would be a valuable asset to any team.

        At Countersight I am entrusted to research, design and implement
        software solutions from the ground up that meet the clients requirements
        and ensure strong maintainability of the code base for future
        development. I am currently the main developer for two big projects for
        our clients. <br />
        <br />
        The first project, I took lead on constructing the Front-end of the
        application and provide high usability and responsive web front, which
        utilized a rich UI library that satisfied the clients beyond their
        expectations. <br />
        <br />
        The second project, I had lead on designing both the front and back end
        of the application, to establish a solid foundation for the rest of my
        colleagues to develop from. My design allowed them to easily implement
        more features quickly and easily. <br />
        <br />I am also responsible for more than just constructing solutions, I
        am relied upon to provide technical direction on projects and which
        technologies to use, advise my colleagues and assist in problem solving
        and to conduct code reviews to ensure that our team's work adheres to
        the best code practices.
