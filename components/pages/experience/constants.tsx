        At Smunch, I lead the <strong>frontend development efforts</strong>,
        collaborating closely with my team to prototype and refine UI/UX designs
        using Figma. This iterative approach allows us to quickly identify and
        implement the most effective design solutions. <br />
        <br />
        Beyond design, I take a <strong>full-stack role</strong>, developing
        both the frontend and backend components to bring these ideas to life.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />I also spearheaded the development of our{" "}
        <strong>mobile app</strong>, enhancing our core product from initial
        design to deployment on the Google Play and Apple App Stores. Using
        React Native with Expo, I guided the project from concept to release,
        ensuring a seamless and high-quality user experience. <br />
        <br />A key aspect of my role is fostering a{" "}
        <strong>cooperative environment</strong> by constructively challenging
        ideas, helping the team refine solutions and achieve the best possible
        outcomes. My work is not just about writing code but about shaping
        products that meet both business and user needs while maintaining high
        development standards.

        In my role, I spearheaded the development of new <strong>UI interfaces</strong> and
        features for our applications. Collaborating with diverse disciplinary
        teams, including <strong>product</strong>, <strong>customer satisfaction</strong>, and <strong>accounting</strong>, was a
        key aspect of my responsibilities. I played a pivotal role in
        translating product team requirements into efficient code and providing
        guidance to colleagues on <strong>CSS techniques</strong> for effective troubleshooting.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Ensuring <strong>continuous deployment</strong> was a priority, and I achieved this by
        creating adaptable code capable of swift adjustments in response to
        evolving business requirements. My achievements include leading the
        implementation of critical features like a <strong>sorting system</strong> based on user
        order history and a user-friendly <strong>weekly overview</strong> to view their current
        orders. <br />
        <br />I successfully contributed to the transformation of an application
        burdened by three levels of <strong>legacy code</strong> into a modernized version,
        receiving high praise from users. Notably, I surpassed deadlines on
        various features by delivering effective solutions and resolved major
        bugs affecting business-critical components such as <strong>customer onboarding</strong>.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        My extensive knowledge of <strong>CSS</strong> played a crucial role in troubleshooting
        both common and niche problems. And providing that knowledge to the rest
        of the team. Overall, my commitment to excellence in front-end
        development is demonstrated through the successful delivery of
        high-quality solutions and contributions to project success.

        At Countersight I am entrusted to research, design and implement
        software solutions from the ground up that meet the clients requirements
        and ensure strong maintainability of the code base for future
        development. I am currently the main developer for two big projects for
        our clients. <br />
        <br />
        The first project, I took lead on constructing the <strong>Front-end</strong> of the
        application and provide high usability and responsive web front, which
        utilized a rich <strong>UI library</strong> that satisfied the clients beyond their
        expectations. <br />
        <br />
        The second project, I had lead on designing both the <strong>front</strong> and <strong>back end</strong>
        of the application, to establish a solid foundation for the rest of my
        colleagues to develop from. My design allowed them to easily implement
        more features quickly and easily. <br />
        <br />I am also responsible for more than just constructing solutions, I
        am relied upon to provide <strong>technical direction</strong> on projects and which
        technologies to use, advise my colleagues and assist in <strong>problem solving</strong>
        and to conduct <strong>code reviews</strong> to ensure that our team's work adheres to
        the best code practices.
