            I am a results-driven full-stack web developer with a passion for
            building impactful digital experiences. I have accelerated project
            timelines, revitalized a legacy application for 10,000 users, and
            improved conversion rates through personalized sorting algorithms
            and user engagement features.
            <br />
            <br />
            By bridging gaps between engineering, product, and customer care
            teams, I improved communication and efficiency, ensuring smoother
            development cycles. My open approach and humor fostered a
            collaborative atmosphere, strengthening team cohesion and
            engagement.
            <br />
            <br />
            I have led frontend design for major projects, implemented complex
            plugin systems in weeks, and optimized application security. My
            problem-solving skills have prevented costly rewrites, enhanced
            performance, and refined UI/UX to exceed expectations.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond coding, I bring energy and creativity to every team. Open to
            opportunities across the EU, Iâ€™m eager to drive innovation and
            deliver high-quality solutions.
